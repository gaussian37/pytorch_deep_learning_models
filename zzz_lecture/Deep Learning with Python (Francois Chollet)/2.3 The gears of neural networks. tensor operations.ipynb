    "finding neat representations for complex, highly folded data manifolds. At this point, you should have a pretty good intuition as to why deep learning excels at this: it takes the approach of incrementally decomposing a complicated geometric transformation into a long chain of elementary ones, which is pretty much the strategy a human would follow to uncrumple a paper ball. Each layer in a deep network applies a transformation that disentagles the data a little - and a deep stack of layers makes tractable an extremely complicated disentanglement process."
