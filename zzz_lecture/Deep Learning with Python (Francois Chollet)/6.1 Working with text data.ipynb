    "This chapter explores deep-learning models that can process text (understood as sequences of word or sequences of characters), timeseries, and sequence data in general. The two fundamental deep-learning algorithms for sequence processing are **recurrent neural networks** and **1D convnets**, the one-dimensional version of the 2D convnets that we covered in the previous chapters. We'll discuss both of these approaches in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications of these algorithms include the following:\n",
    "+ Document classification and timeseries classification, such as identifying the topic of an article or the author of a book\n",
    "+ Timeseries comparisons, such as estimating how closely related two documents or two stock tickers are \n",
    "+ Sequence-tosequence learning, such as decoding an English sentence into French\n",
    "+ Sentiment analysis, such as classifying the sentiment of tweets or movie reviews as positive or negative\n",
    "+ Timeseries forecasting, such as predicting the future weather at a certain location, given recent weather data\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter's examples focus on two narrow tasks: <span class=\"mark\">sentiment analysis</span> on the IMDB dataset, a task we approached earlier in the book, and <span class=\"mark\">temperature forecasting</span>. But the techniques demonstrated for these two tasks are relevant to all the applications just listed, and many more."
