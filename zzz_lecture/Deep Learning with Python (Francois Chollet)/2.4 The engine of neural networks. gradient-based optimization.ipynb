    "As you saw in the the previous section, each neural layer from our first network example tranforms its input data as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    output = relu(dot(W, input) + b)\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this expression, **W** and **b** are tensors that are attributes of the layer. They're called the <span class=\"mark\">**weight**</span> or <span class=\"mark\">**trainable parameters**</span> of the layer. Theses weights contain the information learned by the network from exposure to training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initally, these wiehgt matrices are filled with small random values (a step called <span class=\"mark\">**random initialization**</span>). Of course, there's no reason to expect that *relu(dot(W, input) + b)*, when **W** and **b** are random, will yield any useful representations. The resulting representations are meaningless -- but they're starting point. **What comes next is to gradually adjust these weight, based on a feedback signal.** This gradual adjustment, also called **training**, is basically the learning that machine learning is all about.\n",
    "\n",
    "This happens within what's called a **training loop**, which works as follows. Repeat these steps in a loop, as long as necessary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Draw a batch of training samples x and corresponding targets y.\n",
    "2. Run the network on x (a step called the forward pass) to obtain predictions y_pred\n",
    "3. Compute the loss of the network on the batch, a measure of the mismatch between y_pred and y.\n",
    "4. Update all weights of the network in a way that slightly reduces the loss on this batch."
