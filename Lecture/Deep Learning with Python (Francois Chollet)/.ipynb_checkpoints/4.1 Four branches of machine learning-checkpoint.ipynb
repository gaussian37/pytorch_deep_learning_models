    "After the threee practical examples in chapter 3, you should be starting to feel familiar with how to approach classification and regression problems using neural networks, and you've witnessed the central problem of machine learning: <span class=\"mark\">overfitting</span>. This chapter will formalize some of your new intuition into a solid conceptual framework for attacking and solving deep-learning problems. We'll consolidate all of these concepts - model evaluation, data preprocessing and feature engineering, and tackling overfitting - into a detailed seven-step workflow for tackling any machine-learning task."

All three are instances of supervised learning, where the goal is to learn the relationship between training inputs and training targets.\n",

    "This is by far the most common case. It consists of learning to map input data to known targets (also called annotations), given a set of examples (often annotated by humans). All four examples you've encountered in this book so far were canonical examples of supervised learning. Generally, almost all applications of deep learning that are in the spotlight these days belong in this category, such as optical character recognition, speech recognition, image classification , and language translation. <br> <br>\n",
    "Although supervised learning mostly consists of classification and regression, there are more exotic variants as well, including the following (with example):\n",
    "- Sequence generation - Given a picture, predict a caption describing it. Sequence generation can sometimes be reformulated as a series of classification problems (such as repeatedly predicting a word or token in a sequence).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Syntax tree prediction - Given a sentence, predict its decomposition into a syntax tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Object detection - Given a picture, draw a bounding box around certain objects inside the picture. This can also be expressed as a classification problem (given many candidate bounding boxes, classify the contents of each one) or as a joint classification and regression problem, where the bounding box coordinates are predicted via vector regression.\n",

    "This branch of machine learning consists of finding interesting transformations of the input data without the help of any targets, for the purposes of data visualization, data compression, or data denoising, or to better understand the correlations present in the data at hand. Unsupervised learning is the bread and butter of data analytics, and it's often a necessary steo in better understanding a dataset before attempting to solve a supervised-learning problem. Dimensionality reduction and clustering are well-known categories of unsupervised learning."

    "This is a specific instance of supervised learning, but it's different enough that that it deserves its own category. Self-supervised learning is supervised learning without human-annotated labels - you can think of it as supervised learning without any humans in the loop. There are still labels involved (because the learning has to be supervised by something), but they're generated from the input data, typically using a heuristic algorith.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, *autuencoders* are well-known instance of self-supervised learning, where the generated targets are the input, unmodified. In the same way, trying to predict the next frame in a video, given past frames, or the next word in a text, given previous words, are instances of self-supervised learning *(temporally supervised learning*, in this case : supervision comes from future input data). Note that the distinction between supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised learning can be blurry sometimes - these categories are more of a continum without solid borders. Self-supervised learning can be reinterpreted as either supervised or unsupervised learning, depending on whether you pay attention to the learning mechanism or to the context of its application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the book, we'll focus specifically on supervised learning, because it's by far the dominant form of deep learning today, with a wide range of industry application. We'll also take a briefer look at self-supervised learning in later chapters."

    "Long overlooked, this branch of machine learning recently started to get a lot of attention after Google DeepMind successfully applied it to learning to play Atari games (and, later, learning to play Go at the highest level). In reinforcement learning, an *agent* receives information about its environment and learns to choose actions that will maximize some reward. For instance, a neural network that \"looks\" at a video game screen and outputs game actions in order to maximize its score can be trained via reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, reinforcement learing is mostly a research area and hasn't yet had significant practical success betond games. In time, however, we expect to see reinforcement learning take over an increasingly large range of real-world applications: self-driving cars, robotics, resouce management, education, and so on. It's an idea whose time has come, or will come soon."
